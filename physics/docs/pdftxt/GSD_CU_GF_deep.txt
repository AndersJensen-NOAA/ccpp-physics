The Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN) eddy diffusivity mass-flux
(EDMF) boundary layer and shallow cloud scheme belong to the family of
eddy diffusivity mass-flux schemes for vertical turbulent mixing in
mesoscale models. While it is commonly called "PBL scheme,"it is worth
noting that they are responsible for all vertical turbulent mixing, not
only that occurring in the planetary boundary  layer. EDMF schemes
provide  a natural, physically appealing way to handle the problem of
nonlocal transport in the convective boundary layer, and a natural
expression of the connection between dry thermals and cumulus clouds.
Because shallow cumulus schemes are part of the boundary layer, the
preferred solution is an integrated boundary layer and shallow cumulus
scheme rather than separate schemes (Arakawa(2004) \cite Arakawa_2004).
Using EMF, there is no need for a triggering condition for cumulus
clouds to form, or for a closure formulation at cloud base. 

Chatfield and Brost (1987) may have been the first to combine eddy
diffusivity, commonly used for PBL mixing, with mass flux, commonly used
to represent the vertical transport within cumulus clouds. Since about
the year 2000, many EDMF schemes have been developed (Angevine 2005;
Hourdin et al. 2002; Pergaud et al. 2009; Rio and Hourdin 2008; Siebesma
and Teixeira 2000; Siebesma et al. 2007; Neggers et al. 2009;
Su \&scaron elj et al. 2012,2013,2014) and several have been implemented in
operational models including the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System
(K \&ouml hler et al.2011), the U.S. Navy Global Environmental Model
(Su \&scaron elj et al. 2014), and the NCEP GFS (Han et al. 2016).

MYNN-EDMF is an enhancement of the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishii-Niino PBL
