/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) v3.0 scientific documentation. This release 
of the CCPP contains two parts: CCPP-Physics (a collection of physical parameterizations) and 
CCPP-Framework (the infrastructure that connects the CCPP-Physics to host models).

The CCPP-Physics is envisioned to contain parameterizations used by NOAA operational models for weather through
seasonal prediction timescales, as well as developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming 
operational implementations. This version contains all parameterizations of the current operational GFS,
plus additional developmental schemes. The CCPP can currently be used with the Single Column Model developed 
by the Global Model Test Bed (GMTB) of the Developmental Testbed Center, as well as with the Weather Application 
of the NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS). 

In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of each 
parameterization, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, and a description of
the algorithm. 
The latest CCPP public release is Version 3.0 (June 2019). While details on it may be found
<a href="https://dtcenter.org/gmtb/users/ccpp/"> GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP)</a> on the DTC website


\b nomenclatures: GFS, NEMSfv3gfs, or FV3GFS referred in this documentation are the Finite-volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) 
non-hydrostatic dynamic core in place of the long-running spectral Gaussian hydrostatic core.
