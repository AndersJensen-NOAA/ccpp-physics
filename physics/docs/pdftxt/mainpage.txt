Welcome to the GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) V2.0 scientific documentation. This version contains all parameterizations of \b the \b 2017 \b Operational \b GFS \b physics \b suite. In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of the parameterizations, including basic description, input/output argument list and general/detailed algorithm.

A major upgrade to the parameterization of GFDL cloud microphysics was implemented in the fv3gfs, which is slate to be operational at NCEP in 2019. It is the most significant change to the GFS physics suite since the Zhao-Carr microphysics scheme was implemented in the NCEP Global Forecasting System(GFS) as a simple scheme and predicted only total cloud condensate. Six prognostic cloud spieces variables have been introduced to enable a more physically based representation of water vapor, mixed-phase (liquid/ice) cloud and precipitating rain/snow/graupel.
To avoid the seperation of dynamic/physics process, a fast process of GFDL cloud physics has been implemented in the E-to-L remapping loop of the FV3 dynamic solver.
