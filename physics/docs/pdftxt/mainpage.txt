/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) v2.0 scientific documentation. This release 
of the CCPP contains two parts: CCPP-Physics (a collection of physical parameterizations) and 
CCPP-framework (the infrastructure that connects the CCPP-physics to host models).

The CCPP-physics is envisioned to contain parameterizations used by NOAA operational models for weather through
seasonal prediction timescales, as well as developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming 
operational implementations. This version contains the parameterizations of the default physics suite
of FV3GFS as of August 2018, along with the microphysics scheme that is used in the operational 
GFS implemented in July of 2017. In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of the 
parameterizations, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, and a description of
the algorithm. 

The most significant change with respect to CCPP-physics v1.0 has been the inclusion of the 
\ref GFDL_cloud, which is undergoing tests for possibly replacing the operational \ref GFS_ZHAOC
in the operational NCEP global model in early 2019. With the GFDL microphysics, six prognostics 
cloud species have been introduced to enable a more physically-based representation of water
vapor, mixed-phase (liquid/ice) clouds and precipitating rain/snow/graupel hydrometeors. When used with 
the FV3 dynamic solver, the GFDL microphysics uses an unique condensation adjustment when variables are
mapped from Lagrangian to Eulerian surfaces.

The public release of CCPP v2 is supported for use with <a href="https://dtcenter.org/GMTB/gmtb_scm_ccpp_doc/index.html"> the GMTB Single Column Model with CCPP</a>. The CCPP v2
is currently being integrated with FV3GFS and is available for use by developers working closely with
NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) development. Future direction for the CCPP includes broad support 
for use with FV3 and addition of new parameterizations for potential transition to operations.
