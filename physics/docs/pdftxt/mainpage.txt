/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) v3.0 scientific documentation. This release 
of the CCPP contains two parts: CCPP-Physics (a collection of physical parameterizations) and 
CCPP-Framework (the infrastructure that connects the CCPP-Physics to host models).

The CCPP-Physics is envisioned to contain parameterizations used by NOAA operational models for weather through
seasonal prediction timescales, as well as developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming 
operational implementations. This version contains all parameterizations of the current operational GFS,
plus additional developmental schemes. The CCPP can currently be used with the Single Column Model developed 
by the Global Model Test Bed (GMTB) of the Developmental Testbed Center, as well as with the Weather Application 
of the NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS). 

In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of each 
parameterization, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, and a description of
the algorithm. 
The latest CCPP public release is Version 3.0 (June 2019). While details on it may be found
<a href="https://dtcenter.org/gmtb/users/ccpp/"> GMTB Common Community Physics Package (CCPP)</a> on the DTC website

\section changelog Release Log
## CCPP V3.0 Physics Scientific Upgrade
some of V3.0's major physics improvements are as follows
- Enhanced cloud-radiation interactions
  - In the previous fv3gfs, all hydrometeor species (liquid cloud, ice, rain, snow, graupel) are combined and re-partitioned and
grouped based solely temperature into ice and liquid before they are used in the radiation calculation. The liquid water radii is
based on a crude formulation. A more physically based method is implemented to use hydrometeor information from the \ref GFDL_cloud
in the radiation calculation. The individual hydrometeor species and their corresponding radii from the \ref GFDL_cloud
are fed into the radiation. To use this function two options needed to be turned on in the \c gfs_physics_nml:
\code
lgfdlmprad = .true.
effr_in    = .true.
\endcode


- Fractional snow/ice/graupel flag
  - The \ref GFDL_cloud predicts rain, snow, graupel and ice falling on the ground. Convective parameterization also 
predicts rain and snow. Redefine snow flag in the LSM (srflag) as a fractional number between frozen precipitation and 
total precipitation.


\b nomenclatures: GFS, NEMSfv3gfs, or FV3GFS referred in this documentation are the Finite-volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) 
non-hydrostatic dynamic core in place of the long-running spectral Gaussian hydrostatic core.
