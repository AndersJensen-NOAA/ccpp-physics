\section des_satmedmf Description

TKE-EDMF is an extended version of \ref GFS_HEDMF (currently operational vertical turbulent mixing schemel) with below advancement:
-# eddy diffusivity (K) is now a function of TKE which is prognostically predicted.
-# EDMF approach is appled for all the unstable PBL (in \ref GFS_HEDMF, it is applied only for strongly unstable PBL) 
-# EDMF approach is also applied to the stratocumulus-top-driven turbulence mixing
-# it includes a moist-adiabatic process when updraft thermal becomes saturated
-# it has a scale-aware capability
-# it includes interaction between TKE and cumulus convection
