\section des_deep Description
 CS (Chikira Sugiyama) deep convection has many unique features that makes it the best 
 cadidate (not one of many!) to use Arakawa-Wu (AW) scale-aware parameterizations:
-# A spectrum of  cloud types defined by cloud base vertical velocity. Liquid and ice detrained to environment. 
-# Vertical velocity calculated at each level for easy implementation of AW scale-awareness for the spectrum of clouds. 
-# Entrainment proportional to parcel buoyancy, more physical reasonable
-# Simple downdraft plume initiated by precipitation, more sophisticated scheme developing in CSU. 
-# Convective Kinetic Energy based assumption, Quasi-equilibrium not needed. 
-# Full tracer transport capability.
