\page subpage_overview Overview of the Code
The GFS physics parameterization suite is called by GMTB-SCM or FV3 after the explicit dynamical computations. The
physics computations are performed only in the vertical. The input information for the physics consists of the values
of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components \f$u/v\f$, temperature \f$T\f$, specific humidity \f$q\f$, cloud
fraction \f$q_a\f$, water contents for cloud liquid \f$q_l\f$, cloud ice \f$q_i\f$, rain \f$q_r\f$, snow \f$q_s\f$, graupel 
\f$q_r\f$, and ozone concentration), the provisional dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields,
both fixed and variable.

In CCPPv2, physics suite have separate modules for different processes. Such modularity is desirable from the model development
and code maintenance point of view. The GFS physics routines are called in the following order as defined in  suite_GFS_operational_2017_scm.xml file:
 + @ref GFS_RRTMG
 + @ref GFS_SFCLYR
 + @ref GFS_NSST
 + @ref GFS_NOAH
 + @ref GFS_SFCSICE
 + @ref GFS_HEDMF
 + @ref GFS_GWDPS
 + @ref GFS_RAYLEIGH
 + @ref GFS_OZPHYS
 + @ref GFS_SAMFdeep
 + @ref GFS_GWDC
 + @ref GFS_SAMFshal
 + @ref GFDL_cloud

The time integration of the physics is based on the following:
- It has be to written in CCPP-compliant modern Fortran with augument table and modules.
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed in separate interstitial routines; Evaluating the forcing terms resulting from the parameterizations at the departure point and at the arrival point ensures the accuracy of the coupling.
- The value of a prognostic variable is updated with the tendency from one process and the next process starts from this updated
value (in what is usually refered to as the sequential splitting (Beljaars(1991) \cite beljaars_1991)).

At NCEP, FV3 coupling to GFS physics suite is straightforward; The primary complication is interpolating between cell-centered, orthogonal
winds used by most physics packages and FV3's staggered non-orthogonal D-grid. Two-stage horizontal re-mapping is used. The D-grid
winds are first transformed to locally orthogonal and unstaggered wind components at cell centers, as input to the physics. The wind
tendencies (du/dt, dv/dt) from the physics are then remapped (using high-order algorithm) back to the native grid for updating the 
prognostic winds. This procedure satifies the "no data no harm" principle - that the interpolation/remapping procedure creates no
tendency on its own if there are no external sources from physics.
