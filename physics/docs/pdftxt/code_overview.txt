\page subpage_overview Overview of the Code
The GFS physics parameterization suite is called by GMTB-SCM or FV3 after the explicit dynamical computations. The
physics computations are performed only in the vertical. The input information for the physics consists of the values
of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components \f$u/v\f$, temperature \f$T\f$, specific humidity \f$q\f$, cloud
fraction \f$q_a\f$, water contents for cloud liquid \f$q_l\f$, cloud ice \f$q_i\f$, rain \f$q_r\f$, snow \f$q_s\f$, graupel 
\f$q_r\f$, and ozone concentration), the provisional dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields,
both fixed and variable.

In CCPPv2, physics suite have separate modules for different processes. Such modularity is desirable from the model development
and code maintenance point of view. The GFS physics routines are called in the following order as defined in  \c suite_GFS_operational_2017_scm.xml file:
 + @ref GFS_RRTMG
 + @ref GFS_SFCLYR
 + @ref GFS_NSST
 + @ref GFS_NOAH
 + @ref GFS_SFCSICE
 + @ref GFS_HEDMF
 + @ref GFS_GWDPS
 + @ref GFS_RAYLEIGH
 + @ref GFS_OZPHYS
 + @ref GFS_SAMFdeep
 + @ref GFS_GWDC
 + @ref GFS_SAMFshal
 + @ref GFDL_cloud

The time integration of the physics is based on the following:
- It has be to written in CCPP-compliant modern Fortran with augument table and modules.
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed in separate interstitial routines; Evaluating the forcing terms resulting from the parameterizations at the departure point and at the arrival point ensures the accuracy of the coupling.
- The value of a prognostic variable is updated with the tendency from one process and the next process starts from this updated
value (in what is usually refered to as the sequential splitting (Beljaars(1991) \cite beljaars_1991)).

While the using of sufficiently small time steps may be acceptable in the context of idealized process studies. Comparably long time steps 
are essential in operational production models for efficiency. It is obvious that the numerics of the parameterized processes has to be compatible 
with the dynamics of the model. In FV3, dynamical time steps are used ranging from 225s for the deterministic C768 forecasts (~13 km 
 in grid spacing), to 450s for C384 forecasts (~25 km) and 1800s for C96 forecasts (~100 km). The default time step of GFDL cloud 
microphysics (\c mp_time) is 150s. If \c mp_time isn't divisible by physics time step or is larger than physics time step, the actual \c mp_time step
becomes dt/NINT[dt/MIN(dt, mp_time)]. Shortwave and Longwave calling interval in GFS RRTMG is 3600s.  The accuracy of the numerical approximation
 of the parameterized equations are often optimized for a given resolution and time step.
