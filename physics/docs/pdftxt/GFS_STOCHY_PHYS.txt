\section des_stochy Description
Traditionally, physical parameterization schemes were assumed to be deterministic, producing representations of small-scale
processes unique to the resolved-scale atmospheric state. This assumption becomes increasingly problematic as computational 
advances permit more accurate simulations at finer resolutions where small-scale processes exhibit more stochastic qualities.
Small-scale convective fluctuations often interact strongly with the nonlinear flow dynamics, with substantial repercussions
for large-scale model evolution. Producing accurate and reliable probabilistic predictions therefore depends critically on
representations of parameterization uncertainties.
