- To enhance the surface-based convective available potential energy (CAPE), more strict convection trigger conditions are applied.
- Enhanced downdraft detrainments start from 60mb above the ground surface rather than from the cloud base.
- Reduced rain evaporation with the removal of wind shear dependency, which helps to reduce cold bias in tropospheric temperature profile especially over Tropics.
- Separation cloud depth of deep and shallow convection is increased to 200 hPa from 150 hPa.
- Updraft entrainment rates for moisture, hydrometeors, and tracers are increased by about 30%.
- A positive definite TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) mass-flux transport scheme for moisture, hydrometeors and tracers and a method for removing negative tracer mixing ratio values have been implemented.


\section pbl_p8 P8 Physics Updates in GFS PBL and Free Atmospheric Turbulence Mixing
\author Jongil Han (NCEP/EMC): Jongil.Han@noaa.gov

- Wind shear effect in characteristic mixing length calculation is included, which reduces the mixing length in a strong shear environment such as a hurricane.
- To better predict surface inversion as well as capping inversion near the PBL top, background diffusivity in the inversion layers is reduced as a function of surface roughness and green vegetation fraction.
- To reduce the PBL overgrowth, the PBL updraft overshoot is not only limited by bulk Richardson number-based-PBL depth, but the virtual potential temperature at top of the surface layer rather than that at the model first layer is also used as the near-surface virtual potential temperature in the bulk-Richardson number computation. This helps to largely suppress the unrealistic widespread popcorn-like precipitation.
- Updraft entrainment rates for moisture, hydrometeors, and tracers are increased by about 30%.
- A positive definite TVD mass-flux transport scheme for moisture, hydrometeors, and tracers and a method for removing negative tracer mixing ratio values have been implemented.


\section sfc_p8 P8 Physics Updates in GFS Surface Layer Physics
\author Jongil Han (NCEP/EMC): Jongil.Han@noaa.gov

- New canopy heat storage parameterization is implemented, which is achieved by reducing sensible heat flux into the PBL scheme as a function of surface roughness and vegetation fraction and helps to reduce nighttime cold and daytime warm 2-meter temperature biases over forested regions. 
- A sea spray effect parameterization is included to enhance sensible and latent heat fluxes, especially for strong wind conditions.  
- To better represent sub-grid scale turbulence variability in the surface layer, a new parameterization for maximum surface layer stability parameter is developed as an inverse function of the background turbulent eddy diffusivity. 
- Thermal roughness length calculation over land has been modified.

\section  reeng_rcld Reengineering of Cloud Property Computation Routines
\author Qingfu Liu (NCEP/EMC): Qingfu.Liu@noaa.gov

Requests have been made by many physics developers and users to rewrite
the cloud routines (progcldXXX) for radiation computation in the program
radiation_clouds.f. Those cloud subroutines are very similar, and
have many lines of common code. We modified the radiation_clouds.f module, 
and includes all the calculations of the cloud properties to a new subroutine 
radiation_clouds_prop. We also moved the common code from subroutines 
progcldXXX to this new subroutine. Subroutine radiation_clouds_prop can be 
called by RRTMG and RRTMGP. A single call to the subroutine 
radiation_clouds_prop can connect to the calculations of the cloud 
radiation properties for all the microphysics schemes.

Summary of the major changes:
- radiation_clouds.f

 A new subroutine “radiation_clouds_prop” is added in the program radiation_clouds.f. This new subroutine contains all the calculations of the cloud radiation properties for all the microphysics. Rename all the subroutines “progcldXXX” to new names based on the input variables imp_physics_XXX, and remove the inactive subroutines from file radiation_clouds.f

- GFS_rrtmg_pre.F90

Removed the “progcldXXX” subroutine calls, and replaced them with a single subroutine call to “radiation_clouds_prop”. 

- radiation_cloud_overlap.F90

Replace the subroutine “get_alpha_exp” with “get_alpha_exper”. The new subroutine revises alpha for exponential random cloud overlap option. This new subroutine is used in programs GFS_rrtmgp_cloud_overlap_pre.F90 and GFS_rrtmgp_gfdlmp_pre.F90.

- Subroutine getml() has been modified. The subroutine computes low, mid, high, total and boundary clouds, and is used in GFS_cloud_diagnostics.F90.
