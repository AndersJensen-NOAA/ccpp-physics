\section gfsv_17_p8_suite_overview Overview

Version 17 of the Global Forecast System (GFS) will be implemented operationally by the NOAA
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in XXXX. GFS_v17_p8 is a prototype of 
the GFS_v17 suite. The primary difference between the GFS_v16 and GFS_v17 suites is: 
- \b Microphysics: The replacement of \ref GFDL_cloud with \ref THOMPSON 
- \b Deep \b Cumulus: \ref CA_p8
- \b Radiation : The replacement of \ref GFS_RRTMG with \ref GFS_RRTMGP
- \b Gravity \b Wave \b Drag: The replacement of \ref GFS_UGWP_v0 with \ref GFS_UNIFIED_UGWP 
- \b Land \b Surface \b Model: The replacement of \ref GFS_NOAH with \ref NoahMP

Besides the above mentioned new schemes, several physics enhancements are introduced since March 2021:
