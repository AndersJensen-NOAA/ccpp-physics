\section des_GFDL_cloud Description
GFDL cloud microphysics scheme is a six-category microphysics scheme to replace Zhao-Carr scheme, and moves the GFS from
a total cloud water variable to five predicted hydrometeors (cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel).
This scheme utilizes the "bulk water" microphysical parameterization technique in Lin et al. (1983) \cite lin_et_al_1983 
and has been significantly improved over years at GFDL (Lord et al.(1984) \cite lord_et_al_1984, 
Krueger et al.(1995) \cite krueger_et_al_1995, Chen and Lin (2011) \cite chen_and_lin_2011, Chen and Lin (2013) \cite chen_and_lin_2013). 
Some unique attributes of GFDL cloud microphysics include:

a. \b Physics \b Processes \b included \b in \b warm_rain() \b and \b icloud()

GFDL cloud MP is feature with time-split between warm-rain (faster) and ice-phase (slower) processes.
(see 'conversion time scale' in gfdl_cloud_microphys.F90 for default values)

b. \b Fast \b Saturation \b Adjustment 

In current fv3gfs, phase-changes is called after the "Lagrangian-to-Eulerian" remapping in FV3
dynamic solver. When fast saturation adjustment \ref fast_sat_adj is activated (fast_sat_adj=.true. in \b fv_core_nml block) to adjust 
cloud water evaporation (cloud water \f$\rightarrow\f$ water vapor), cloud water freezing (cloud water \f$\rightarrow\f$ cloud ice),
cloud ice deposition (water vapor \f$\rightarrow\f$ cloud ice). 

 Thermodynamic consistency between the dynamics and cloud microphysics:
  - exact local moist energy conservation between phase changes
  - condensates carry heat & 3D momentum


c. \b Horizontal \b Sub-grid \b Variability

Scale-awareness achieved by an assumed horizontal subgrid variability and a 2nd
order FV-type vertical reconstruction (Lin et al.(1994) \cite lin_et_al_1994) for autoconversions (ice->snow)



d. \b Cloud \b Fraction

Similar to autoconversion, calculation of cloud fraction is based on horizontal sub-grid variability. Cloud fraction
calculation includes all hydrometers.

e. \b Time \b implicit monotonic scheme for terminal fall of condensates
