\section cs_descrip  Description

Chikira-Sugiyama cumulus scheme (Chikira and Sugiyama 2010 \cite chikira_and_sugiyama_2010) with prognostic closure and
Arakawa-Wu Scale-Aware extension is an offshoot of the prognostic Arakawa-Schubert scheme. It is characterized by lateral
entrainment rates that vertically varies depending on buoyancy and vertical velocity of updraft air parcel following
Gregory (2001) and spectral representation of cloud types according to updraft velocity at cloud base. Cloud base mass 
flux is determined by convective kinetic energy closure ()


Chikira-Sugiyama convection with Arakawa-Wu extension (CSAW)
- A community R2O project via CPO/CTB/CPT
- Based on Chikira-Sugiyama(2010) and Arakawa-Wu (2013) \cite arakawa_and_wu_2013
- A Generalization of the Unified parameterization - Chikira, Randall and Dazlich
- "What matters in generalizing the conventional cumulus parameterization is the dependence on the fractional convective
cloudiness, not directly on the grid spacing" - Arakawa and Wu (2013)

CSAW follows the above in applying unified parameterization to CS (i.e. the updraft fraction is not directly determined
by grid spacing).

CSAW in IPDv4
- Based on entraining plume model
- Spectral representation of updraft ensemble - cloud types represented by cloud base updraft velocity
- Entrainment rate changes vertically depending on buoyancy and vertical velocity (Gregory, 2001)
- Cloud base mass flux determined using prognostic Arakawa-Schubert approach (Pan and Randall, 1998 \cite pan_and_randall_1998)
- Generalized unified parameterization convective contributions through eddy flux convergence and local condensation/evaporation
- Downdraft in CSAW is very simple (non-spectral)
- CSAW has been tested with NEMS/FV3 at C96L127, C384L127, C768L127
