\section thompson_descrp  Description


The GSD RAP/HRRR microphysics implementation represents the most aggressive attempt to include explicit prediction of
cloud and precipitation microphysical processes in the NCEP operational forecast model suite. The RAP and HRRR are
important guidance to NWS aviation forecasts, and any microphysics improvements are aimed at least in part, to improve 
that guidance. The scheme is particularly beneficial for aircraft icing forecasts.

The scheme computes sources, sinks, and conversions for the mixing ratios of cloud water, rainwater, cloud ice, snow,
and graupel. Number concentration for cloud ice (particles per cubic meter) is also forecast, based on statistical relationships
of number concentration, density, and ice mass from recent observational studies. Since April 2014 (WRFv3.6), this is also the "aerosol-aware" scheme as described in
Thompson and Eidhammer (2014) \cite Thompson_2014 .

The microphysical processes accounted for are shown in the graphic below:
