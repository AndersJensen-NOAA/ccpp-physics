\section thompson_descrp  Description

This scheme computes the moisture tendencies of water vapor, cloud droplets, rain, cloud ice(pristine),
snow, and graupel. Developed mainly for application in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model,
this code was based on Reisner et al (1998) until Dec 2006 (prior to WRFv2.2), but few of those pieces 
remain. A complete description is now found in Thompson et al.(2008) \cite Thompson_2008 . Until Apr 2009
(prior to WRFv3.1), this code was single-moment rain prediction, but in v3.1 and higher, the scheme is
two-moment rain (i.e., predict rain number concentration).

Since April 2014 (WRFv3.6), this is also the "aerosol-aware" scheme as described in 
Thompson and Eidhammer (2014) \cite Thompson_2014 . The non aerosol-aware version of the code utilizes the older
one-moment cloud water with constant droplet concentration set as \p nt_c, while the aerosol-aware version
uses double-moment cloud droplet number concentration, which is not permitted to exceed \p nt_c_max.

Most importantly, users may wish to modify the prescribed number of cloud droplets (\p nt_c). 
Otherwise, users may alter the rain and graupel size distribution paramters to use exponential (Marshal-Palmer)
or generalized gamma shape. The snow field assumes a combination of two gamma functions (from Field et al. 2005)
and would require significant modifications throughout the entire code to alter its shape as well as accretion 
rates. Users may also alter the constants used for density of rain, graupel, ice and snow, but the latter is not
constant when using Paul Field's snow distribution and moments methods. Other values users can modify include
the constants for mass and/or velocity power law relations and assumed capacitances used in deposition/sublimation/evaporation/melting.
Remaining values should probably be left alone.
