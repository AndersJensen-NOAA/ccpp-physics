\section allscheme_overview Overview
In the CCPP-Physics v3.0 code, each parameterization is placed in its own modern Fortran module, which facilitates model development and
code maintenance. While some individual parameterization can be invoked for GMTB SCM, most users will assemble the 
parameterizations in suites. 


- For PBL and turbulence parameterizations
 - \ref GFS_HEDMF
 - \ref GFS_SATMEDMF
 - \ref GSD_MYNNEDMF

- For land surface model
 - \ref GFS_NOAH
 - \ref GSD_RUCLSM

- For cumulus parameterizations:
 - \ref CSAW_deep
 - \ref GFS_SAMFdeep
 - \ref GSD_GFDEEP

In addition to the physical schemes themselves, this scientific documentation also covers four modules that define physics/radiation functions, parameters and constants:
 - \subpage func_phys
 - \subpage phy_sparam
 - \subpgae physcons
 - \subpage radcons

The parameterizations included in the CCPP-Physics v3.0 are all column-based, that is, computations are performed only in the vertical.
The input information for the physics include the values of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components, temperature,
specific humidity, cloud fraction, vater contents for cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel, and ozone concentration), the provisional
 dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields, both fixed and variable.

The time integration of the GFS physics suite is based on the following:
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed by the parameterizations or derived in separate interstitial routines;
- The first part of the suite, comprised of the parameterizations for radiation, surface layer, surface (land, ocean, and sea ice), boundary layer,
orographic gravity wave drag, and Rayleigh damping, is computed using a hybrid of parallel and sequential splitting (Donahue and Caldwell(2018)
\cite donahue_and_caldwell_2018), a method in which the various parameterizations use the same model state as input but feel the effect of the preceding
parameterizations. The tendencies from the various parameterizations are then added together and used to update the model state.
- The second part of the physics suite, comprised of the parameterizations of ozone, stratospheric \f$H_2O\f$, deep convection, convective gravity wave drag,
shallow convection, and microphysics, is computed using sequential splitting in the order listed above, in which the model state is updated between calls
to the parameterization.
