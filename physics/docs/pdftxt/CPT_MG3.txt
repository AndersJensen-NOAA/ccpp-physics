\section des_MG3_cloud Description
MG3 microphysics (MP) scheme is a six-category double momentum bulk scheme. It forecasts mass of ten 
hydrometeors (cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel) and their number concentrations in addition to mass of water vapor.
\cite Gettelman_Morrison_2015,
\cite Gettelman_et_al_2015. 
Physics processes of MG3 cloud MP are described in Figure 1.

Some unique attributes of MG3 cloud microphysics include:

-# Consistent treatment of cloud fraction in cloud macrophysics and radiation
-# Subgrid-scale microphysics
-# Max-overlap and in-cloud precipitation fraction area
-# Options for subcolumn microphysics
-# Options to run MG2 using the same code as MG3
-# Options to run MG1 
-# Completely aerosol awareness with 1) 1) constant aerosol mixing ratio, 2) climatology IN/CCN from CAM5,  3) climatology aerosol from MERRA2 , 4) GOCART, and  5) MAM7
-# Options to call fast physics as GFDL microphysics
-# Number concentration of all species forcasted and has local storage
-# Sub-step semi-implicit sedimentation
