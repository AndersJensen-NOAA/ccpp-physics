With funding from the Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) initiative and broad support from the community NCEP/EMC recently
replaced the dynamic core in its flagship operational model, the GFS. Version 15 of the GFS (GFSv15), schedule for implementation in 
middle 2019, will include the Finite-volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) non-hydrostatic dynamic core in place of the long-running spectral Gaussian
hydrostatic core. This modeling system serves as the atmospheric foundation for the emerging Unified Forecast System (UFS) that is 
envisioned as a full community-based Earth-System model.

The next major upgrade of the GFS is expected to be in the area of model physics.Physics upgrades are particular challenging.But community
support, enhanced collaborations, and the CCPP framework are now making it feasible to accelerate advancements in operational model physics
through wholesale replacement of individual parameterizations or even entire parameterizations suites.

Current plans call for major changes to the GFSv15 parameterization suite in anticipation of the GFSv16 implementaion, schedule for FY2021.
Several parameterizations have been identified as likely new components of the \b GFSv16 suite, including:
- The \b RRTMGP radiation parameterization, developed by Robert Pincus and colleagues, is scheduled to replace the current \ref GFS_RRTMG
- The \b Noah-MP land-surface parameterization is expected to replace the current \ref GFS_NOAH
- A unified gravity-wave-drag (\b UGWD) parameterization, developed by Valery Yudin and collaborators, will replace the separate 
\ref GFS_GWDPS and \ref GFS_GWDC currently being used.
- Fresh-water lake (\b FLAKE) and multi-layer snow parameterizations will be introduced to enhance the representation of earth-atmosphere
interactions.

In addition, new parameterizations for deep and shallow moist convection (CP), cloud microphysics (MP), and planetary boundary layer (PBLP)/
turbulence are being considered. Unlike the parameterizations mentioned above, there are multiple viable options for parameterizing these 
processes in GFSv16, including the schemes currently used in GFSv15. The "suite" approach is being taken for this subset of all model 
parameterizations because the individual parameterizations within each candidate CP-MP-PBLP suite are highly interdependent. Thus, optimal
performance typically has been achieved within the candidate suites through collective tuning of individual parameterizations. Developers
have been invited to contribute their parameterizations as members of pre-tuned suites in hopes of optimizing performance in the GFS. This
approach is one way of "leveling the playing field" so that parameterizations developed outside the GFS framework are not unduly handicapped
by sub-optimal interactions with other GFS parameterizations. 

\section advphys_overview Physics Suites Description

Two suites of CP-MP-PBLP parameterizations have been identified as possible replacements for the current GFSv15 suite. \b GSD \b suite is 
derived from the operational Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) modeling system \cite Benjamin_2016 and was developed largely at NOAA/OAR/ESRL/GSD for mesoscale applications, while the second candidate, i.e., the \b CPT \b suite, has components that were
developed at multiple ressearch centers and universities, including Colorado State, Utah, NASA, NCAR, and EMC. Its individual 
parameterizations have been applied primarily to medium-range and longer prediction scales. For the GFSv15 suite, a very similar suite, but
with TKE-EDMF in repace of K-EDMF have been developed at EMC (Han et al. 2019, manuscript accepted by WAF).
