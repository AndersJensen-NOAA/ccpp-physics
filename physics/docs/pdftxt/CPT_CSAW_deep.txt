\section cs_deep Description

Chikira-Sugiyama cumulus scheme (Chikira and Sugiyama (2010) \cite Chikira_2010) with prognostic closure and 
Arakawa-Wu scale-aware extension \cite Arakawa_2013 is an offshoot of the prognostic Arakawa-Schubert scheme.
It is characterized by lateral entrainment rates that vertically varies depending on buoyancy and vertical 
velocity of updraft air parcel following Gregory (2001) \cite Gregory_2001 and spectral representation of cloud
types according to updraft velocity at cloud base. Cloud base mass flux is determined by convective kinetic 
energy closure. The entrainment rate tends to be large near cloud base because of the small updraft velocity near
that level. Deep convection tends to be suppressed when convective available potential energy is small because of 
upward reduction of in-cloud moist static energy. Dry environmental air significantly reduces in-cloud humidity 
mainly because of the large entrainment rate in the lower troposphere, which leads to suppression of deep convection,
consistent with observations and previous of cloud-resolving models.
