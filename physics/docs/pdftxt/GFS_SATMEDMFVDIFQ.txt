\section des_satmedmfvdifq Description

The current operational \ref GFS_HEDMF uses a hybrid EDMF parameterization for the convective PBL (Han et al. 2016 \cite Han_2016;
Han et al. 2017 \cite han_et_al_2017), where the EDMF scheme is applied only for the strongly unstable PBL, while the eddy-diffusivity
counter-gradient(EDCG) scheme is used for the weakly unstable PBL. The new TKE-EDMF is an extended version of \ref GFS_HEDMF  with below enhancement:

-# Eddy diffusivity (K) is now a function of TKE which is prognostically predicted

-# EDMF approach is applied for all the unstable PBL 

-# EDMF approach is also applied to the stratocumulus-top-driven turbulence mixing

-# It includes a moist-adiabatic process when updraft thermal becomes saturated

-# Scale-aware capability

-# It includes interaction between TKE and cumulus convection

The CCPP-compliant subroutine satmedmfvdifq_run() computes subgrid vertical turbulence mixing using scale-aware
TKE-based moist eddy-diffusion mass-flux paramterization (Han et al. 2019 \cite Han_2019)
- For the convective boundary layer, the scheme adopts EDMF parameterization (Siebesma et al. (2007)\cite Siebesma_2007)
to take into account nonlocal transport by large eddies(mfpbltq.f)
- A new mass-flux paramterization for stratocumulus-top-induced turbulence mixing has been introduced (mfscuq.f; previously,
it was an eddy diffusion form)
- For local turbulence mixing, a TKE closure model is used.

- Wind shear effect in characteristic mixing length calculation is included, which 
reduces the mixing length in a strong shear environment such as a hurricane.
- To better predict surface inversion as well as capping inversion near the PBL top, 
background diffusivity in the inversion layers is reduced as a function of surface 
roughness and green vegetation fraction.
- To reduce the PBL overgrowth, the PBL updraft overshoot is not only limited by 
bulk Richardson number-based-PBL depth, but the virtual potential temperature at 
top of the surface layer rather than that at the model first layer is also used as 
the near-surface virtual potential temperature in the bulk-Richardson number 
computation. This helps to largely suppress the unrealistic widespread popcorn-like precipitation.
- Updraft entrainment rates for moisture, hydrometeors, and tracers are increased by about 30%.
- A positive definite TVD mass-flux transport scheme for moisture, hydrometeors, 
and tracers and a method for removing negative tracer mixing ratio values have been implemented.
